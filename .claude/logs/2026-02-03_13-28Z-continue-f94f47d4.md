I'll help you resume the TDD workflow. Let me first check the current workflow state.

## Current Workflow State

```
Feature: InvestInsight-Product-Guide-v2
Epic: 1
Phase: PLAN
Status: In progress - no epics/stories created yet
```

**What I found:**
- Feature spec exists: [documentation\InvestInsight-Product-Guide-v2.md](documentation/InvestInsight-Product-Guide-v2.md)
- 20 wireframes have been created (DESIGN phase complete)
- Currently in **PLAN phase** - need to create all epics and stories with acceptance criteria
- No epic or story files have been created yet

**Next step:** I need to resume with the `feature-planner` agent to complete the PLAN phase by creating all epics and stories from the feature specification.

Is this correct? Should I proceed with the feature-planner to create the epics and stories?

**Result:**
Perfect. Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the InvestInsight platform. Let me break down this complex application into epics and stories. Based on the specification and wireframes, I'll organize this into logical implementation phases.

## Proposed Epic Breakdown

The feature-planner has analyzed the InvestInsight specification and proposes breaking it down into **7 epics**:

### Epic 1: Start Page & Batch Management
Home page with batch creation, current status display, and navigation to key features

### Epic 2: File Upload Infrastructure
Portfolio and Other Imports dashboards with file status matrix and upload modal functionality

### Epic 3: Data Confirmation System
Three-tab confirmation interface to verify data completeness before approvals

### Epic 4: Instruments & Index Prices Maintenance
CRUD screens for instruments master data and index prices with audit trails

### Epic 5: Risk Data Maintenance
CRUD screens for durations, betas, and credit ratings with outstanding items tracking

### Epic 6: Report Comments & Multi-Level Approvals
Report commentary system and three-level approval workflow

### Epic 7: Process Logs & Monitoring
File, workflow, and calculation logs for operational support and debugging

**Implementation Order Rationale:**
- Epics 1-2: Foundation (home page + data intake)
- Epic 3: Validation layer
- Epics 4-5: Data maintenance (depends on validation)
- Epic 6: Approval workflow (depends on complete data)
- Epic 7: Monitoring and debugging capabilities

Does this epic breakdown look good to you? Should the feature-planner proceed to create detailed stories with acceptance criteria for all 7 epics?
