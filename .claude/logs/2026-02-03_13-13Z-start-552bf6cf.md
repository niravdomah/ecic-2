I'll start the TDD workflow. Let me first check for feature specifications in the documentation/ directory.

I found the InvestInsight Product Guide specification. This is a comprehensive portfolio reporting and data stewardship platform with **12 main screens** including:

- Start Page and Monthly Process Workflow
- File upload dashboards (Portfolio & Other Imports)
- Data Confirmation screens
- Multiple maintenance screens (Instruments, Index Prices, Durations, Betas, Credit Ratings)
- Multi-level Approvals (L1, L2, L3)
- Process Logs and Administration

This feature involves **extensive UI components** including grids, dashboards, modals, forms, and complex workflows.

**Would you like me to create wireframes first using the ui-ux-designer agent, or proceed directly to planning?**

Creating wireframes would help visualize the screen layouts, dashboard structures, and interaction patterns before we begin implementation planning.

Now I'll analyze the specification and propose a comprehensive screen list for approval.

## Proposed Screens

I'll create wireframes first. Let me initialize the workflow state for the DESIGN phase and then start the ui-ux-designer agent.

_**Agent (model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Perfect! Workflow state initialized for DESIGN phase. Now I'll launch the **ui-ux-designer** agent to create wireframes for the InvestInsight application.

Task: Create UI wireframes

---

_**Agent (model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

The **ui-ux-designer** agent has analyzed the specification and proposed **19 screens** for wireframe creation:

### Core Workflow Screens
1. **Start Page** - Dashboard with batch status and workflow state
2. **Portfolio Imports Dashboard** - Matrix grid (portfolios Ã— file types)
3. **Other Imports Dashboard** - List view for shared reference files
4. **File Upload Modal** - Popup for file management and error viewing

### Data Confirmation Screens
5. **Data Confirmation - Main File Checks Tab**
6. **Data Confirmation - Other Checks Tab**
7. **Data Confirmation - Re-imports Tab**

### Maintenance Screens
8. **Instruments Maintenance** - CRUD grid with audit trail
9. **Index Prices Maintenance** - CRUD grid with history
10. **Durations & YTM Maintenance** - CRUD grid + outstanding items
11. **Instrument Betas Maintenance** - CRUD grid + outstanding items
12. **Credit Ratings Maintenance** - CRUD grid + rating changes view
13. **Report Comments** - CRUD grid

### Approval Screens
14. **Approvals Dashboard (L1)** - First level approval
15. **Approvals Dashboard (L2)** - Second level approval
16. **Approvals Dashboard (L3)** - Third level with mandatory rejection reason

### Process Logs Screens
17. **Process Logs - File Logs**
18. **Process Logs - Monthly Workflow Logs**
19. **Process Logs - Calculation Logs**

**Do you approve this screen list for wireframe creation?** The agent will create ASCII wireframes for each screen showing layouts, components, and navigation patterns.

**Result:**
Now I need to present the wireframes for approval before committing.

All 19 wireframes have been created and saved to `generated-docs/wireframes/`. Let me present them for your approval:

## Wireframes Ready for Review

I've created 19 wireframes in `generated-docs/wireframes/`:

_**Agent (model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Perfect! I'll instruct the ui-ux-designer to proceed with creating wireframes for all 19 screens.

_**Agent (model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_



Task: Create approved wireframes

_**Agent (model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Excellent! The **ui-ux-designer** has created all **19 wireframes** and saved them to [generated-docs/wireframes/](generated-docs/wireframes/).

### Wireframes Created

All wireframes include ASCII art layouts, component descriptions, user actions, and navigation flows:

**Core Workflow:** Start Page, Portfolio Imports Dashboard, Other Imports Dashboard, File Upload Modal

**Data Confirmation:** Main File Checks, Other Checks, Re-imports tabs

**Maintenance Screens:** Instruments, Index Prices, Durations & YTM, Betas, Credit Ratings, Report Comments

**Approvals:** L1, L2, L3 dashboards

**Process Logs:** File Logs, Monthly Workflow Logs, Calculation Logs

Plus an overview document summarizing all screens.

**Would you like to:**
1. **Approve all wireframes** - Agent will commit them and proceed to planning phase
2. **Review specific wireframes first** - Let me know which screens you'd like to see
3. **Request changes** - Specify any modifications needed

_**Agent (model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

The **ui-ux-designer** has successfully completed the DESIGN phase:

âœ… **19 wireframes created** and saved to [generated-docs/wireframes/](generated-docs/wireframes/)  
âœ… **Committed and pushed** to main branch (commit `21e6b5e`)  
âœ… **Workflow transitioned** to PLAN phase

### Next: PLAN Phase

The **feature-planner** agent will:
- Break the spec into epics
- Write user stories for each epic
- Create acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- Reference wireframes for UI implementation

**Would you like to clear context before proceeding to the PLAN phase?** (Recommended: yes)

If yes, use `/clear` then `/continue` to resume with fresh context.
