# Epic 6: Report Comments & Multi-Level Approvals

## Description
Implements the report commentary system and three-level approval workflow (Level 1: Portfolio Manager, Level 2: Risk Manager, Level 3: Chief Investment Officer). Users can add/edit report comments with rich text, submit batches for approval, and approve/reject with comments. Each approval level unlocks the next level until final approval is granted.
