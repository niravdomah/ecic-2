# Epic 2: File Upload Infrastructure

## Description
Implements the file upload system for Portfolio Manager data (Holdings, Transactions, Income, Cash, Performance, Management Fees) and Other data (Custodian files, Bloomberg holdings). Users can view file status matrices showing which files are uploaded for each portfolio, upload new files via a modal dialog, and navigate between Portfolio Imports and Other Imports dashboards.
