# Epic 3: Data Confirmation System

## Description
Implements the three-tab data confirmation interface that validates all uploaded files are complete and correct before proceeding to approvals. Users can view Main File Checks (portfolio manager, custodian, Bloomberg data), Other Checks (calculated metrics), and Portfolio Re-imports (historical import tracking). Incomplete items are clickable and navigate back to file uploads for correction.
